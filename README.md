# cc65-dbg

This vscode extension adds syntax and debugger support for cc65 and ca65.

## Features

Works with any adapter/emulator supporting Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

You need to provide your own debugger or debug adapter as `"command"` option,
which is able to communicate using DAP protocol over stdin/stdout or TCP socket.

The main job of this extension is to parse [debug info][1] file generated by
`ld65 --dbgfile` and use the information to drive the debugger executable.
It expects the file to be placed beside the `"program"` binary,
with `.dbg` extension.
