# cc65-dbg

This VS Code extension adds syntax and debugger support for cc65 and ca65.

## Features

Works with an adapter/emulator supporting Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

You need to provide your own debugger or debug adapter as `"command"` option,
which is able to communicate using DAP protocol over stdin/stdout or TCP socket.

The main job of this extension is to parse [debug info][1] file generated by
`ld65 --dbgfile` and use the information to drive the debugger executable.
It expects the file to be placed beside the `"program"` binary,
with `.dbg` extension.

The idea is that your debugger/adapter should not know about the format of the source
nor the assembler or compiler. It should just support breakpoints and interactive debugging.  
On the other side, the debugging extension for particular assembler/compiler should work
with many debuggers/emulators, supporting DAP protocol.

### Requirements

> ⚠️ Following is a deviation from Debug Adapter Protocol, used to simplify
> the DAP-debugger implementation for 8-bit machine emulators.

The extension will present the breakpoint memory addresses as `lines` property
of [SetBreakpoints Request][2]. Debugger does not need to know anything
about the source structure - this is the job of the extension. It just needs to be able to
set *memory breakpoints*, pause and step through the program execution.

Breakpoints are presented in packs identified with `sourceReference` number
(`0` included) of [Source][3] descriptor. Your debugger endpoint should track the
source reference number of a breakpoint in order to remove it, when an update
for the pack is being received.
